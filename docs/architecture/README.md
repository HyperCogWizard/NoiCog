# NoiCog Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive architecture documentation for the NoiCog system, featuring detailed Mermaid diagrams that illustrate the cognitive and technical architecture of this AI-enhanced browser platform.

## Architecture Documents

1. **[System Overview](./system-overview.md)** - High-level system architecture and principal components
2. **[Extension Architecture](./extension-architecture.md)** - Plugin system design and module interactions  
3. **[OpenCog Integration](./opencog-integration.md)** - Cognitive subsystem architecture and neural-symbolic integration
4. **[Data Flow Patterns](./data-flow-patterns.md)** - Signal propagation and information flow pathways
5. **[Recursive Implementation](./recursive-implementation.md)** - Emergent patterns and adaptive mechanisms

## Navigation

Each document contains:
- Interactive Mermaid diagrams
- Detailed technical annotations
