## Key Architectural Principles

### **Hypergraph-Centric Design**
All system components implement hypergraph patterns enabling complex relational reasoning and knowledge representation.

### **Recursive Implementation Pathways**  
Self-modifying systems that can reason about and evolve their own architecture through meta-cognitive patterns.

### **Adaptive Attention Allocation**
Dynamic resource management based on cognitive load analysis and emergent priority optimization.

### **Neural-Symbolic Integration**
Bidirectional translation between symbolic reasoning and neural processing for enhanced cognitive capabilities.

### **Distributed Cognitive Synergy**
Multiple AI services working in coordination to achieve collective intelligence beyond individual capabilities.
